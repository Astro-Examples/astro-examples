## Documentation for the Rest of Us

We all love the extensive documentation that has been created for `numpy`, `scipy`, and `matplotlib`, the tools of the trade in astronomy. But sometimes the provided examples are... lacking. 

This project represents the ongoing work of students in the Astro 330 class at Yale to construct astronomy-oriented, well motivated, and well described example usages for many of these basic (to complicated) functions. 

To access the examples, use the links below. More functions (and libraries) may be added in the future!

### numpy 
### scipy
### matplotlib
